## 1.2 Introduction
I will be speaking and producing a management plan about our ZSL client (london zoo) where we were asked to design and develop a game based around 4 habitats. ZSL were going to use it to help them teach the 11-16 year olds that come into the zoo. It would give the children a more engaging and interactive session. Which ZSL hope will help the student to better understand the work and increase the chances of them remembering and leanring more if the session is fun.
