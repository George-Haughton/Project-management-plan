# 1. Project-management-plan

## 1.2 Introduction
I will be speaking and producing a management plan about our ZSL client (london zoo) where we were asked to design and develop a game based around 4 habitats. ZSL were going to use it to help them teach the 11-16 year olds that come into the zoo. It would give the children a more engaging and interactive session. Which ZSL hope will help the student to better understand the work and increase the chances of them remembering and leanring more if the session is fun.

### 1.3 Cost
There are a few things we are going to look at that relate to cost within this project. Firstly, we will look at the cost of the systems we used. These would be the cost of the computers we used during class and my personal system I have at home. The systems at the college cost around £1500 and these were perfect as they had the exact tools we needed, the exact computer specifications that would support what we needed to do and they were also the computers we knew well as we had used them in past projects; and as there were 4 in our group so the costs together would be $6000. Additionally, my home computer is a lot more equipped for this project as I know the ins and outs of it and its computer specifications are a lot more up to date and considerably more power than the ones we have at college. This system costs £1200 which puts our system costs at £7200. Secondly, I’m going to speak about the costs of the time it took for us to complete the project. As we were using this project as a learning experience and not as a profit gain we worked for free as we thought this would benefit us a lot more, because we wanted to improve ourselves as programmers and didn’t feel we were ready to charge them and didn’t feel it necessary or fair. Thirdly, I will discuss the software that we used to complete this project. The standard software that we used were Microsoft word to write down notes, feedback and the requirements and we used power point to create a presentation of our ideas for ZSL (London Zoo). These were both completely free which helped us a lot. Additionally, the main software we used was Unity which is a game developing platform, we used this to create our concept art and create the animations for the game. This license costs around £125 per person for one month, and a we had four group members it would come to a total of £500; so the total system costs are £500. Fourthly, our lecturer took a coach driving course so he could drive us to the London Zoo, I could not find out how much this course cost but this is the way we got to the Zoo and back and we were not told how much it cost as the college paid for the travel and things of this nature. Lastly, we needed a stable internet connection for us to carry out our research and as we were at college we do not know how much it cost them to provide us with it but as I did work at home using the internet I have there; I can use this to calculate how much was spent on internet access. My internet costs £30 per month which puts our known internet cost for the project at £30.

### Scope
The main objective of this project was to create a fun, interactive game that the ZSL (London Zoo) teachers/staff could use to better their classes and make sure the 11-16 year olds learnt more, were more engaged throughout the lesson and overall make the children enjoy the lesson a lot more.  The game will consist of 4 habitats which the user/child can pick one at a time which one they would like to play through. Each habitat will have a chain that the users/children will have to complete by dragging the correct part of the chain in its correct position within the chain. As a helping hand we will give them the first part/start and the last/end of the chain; just so they have a small idea of what to do and not confused.
